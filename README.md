## Features

As a user, you can:

1. **View Transactions**: See a table displaying all your recent bank transactions.

2. **Add Transactions**: Fill out and submit a form to add a new transaction. The new transaction will be immediately added to the table. Please note that the new transaction is not persisted to the backend.

3. **Filter Transactions**: Use the search bar to filter transactions. Only transactions with a description matching the search term will be shown in the transactions table.
